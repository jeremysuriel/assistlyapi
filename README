AssistlyAPI is a modified version of Twurl for the purposes of testing the Assistly API

+-----------------+
| Getting Started |
+-----------------+

The first thing you have to do is register an OAuth application
to get a consumer key and secret.  Log into your Assistly Support Admin
and navigation to "General Settings"->"API Applications"


When you have your consumer key and its secret you authorize
your Assistly account to make API requests with your consumer key
and secret.

  % assistlyapi authorize 
		--host my_subdomain.assistly.com
		--consumer-key the_key 
		--consumer-secret the_secret


						
This will return an URL that you should open up in your browser.
Authenticate to Assistly, and then enter the returned PIN back into
the terminal.  Assuming all that works well, you will be authorized
to make requests with the API.


+-----------------+
| Making Requests |
+-----------------+

The simplest request just requires that you specify the path you
want to request along with the hostname for your assistly site.

  % assistlyapi --host my_subdomain.assistly.local -U "/api/v1/cases.json"
